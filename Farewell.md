# Farewell DTS
![header](https://i.imgur.com/vcIpnDd.png)
**Important note:** This is for Farewell with the Dash Trigger Skip or short DTS which allows you to play Farewell up to Stubborness with 2 dashes. Cues for 1 dash Farewell are not planned as of yet, but some strats are similar and from [Stubbornness](#stubbornness) onwards it's the same as 1 dash.
\
Jelly mechanics are kinda weird at first so I recommend you give [Jelly Mechanics](https://github.com/Tiyo98/farewell-cue-collection/blob/main/jellymechanics.md). I do explain some important ones again but it's highly recommend to read it first regardless.
Also moonblocks move on a cycle so be aware of that if you set save states or use the debug map when practicing.

  \
  Pausebuffer a talk out of a pause and then a fullheight jump out of the next pause. You can't interact with the grave in dash state so you have to wait until it's over or don't dash. It's highly recommended to use a pause+talk button for this. You can bind talk to your normal pause button without any currently known issues.
  \
  There are 2 options now. The recommended one is that you can count how many bounces the white arrow in the bottom right of text box does. Skip the cutscene after 11 bounces. Or alternatively wait until Madeline is off screen and look at the timer and wait 15 seconds before skipping the cutscene.

   \
   Do an updash and an upright to get to the moonblock. Land and buffer an updash and delay another updash. Buffer a left jump when you land again. Wallkick low of the moonblock while holding right and when you're in line with it, do a right dash and neutral super. The jump of the super should not be in coyote, so try to aim for middle or right side of the block.
   Do an updemo and drift slightly to the right before doing the right dash.
   \
   An annoying part is the trigger you don't see, so I recommend learning the strat with the hitbox view and center cam of the [Celeste TAS mod](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6715) if you're on PC before eventually transitioning into doing the strat without it. For more setups I recommend the [video guide by fishmcmuffins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al_3Wu27C4M).

  Wavedash with a low jump and start buffering dashes at the cue. Demohyper and downright into the transition. If you're too high to do a midair demohyper, just drop a bit or right dash and demo/downright into the transition.

  Honestly weird strat and idk if I should recommend it, but you can back it up quite easily. Hyper bhop and start the downright dash at the hole in the bg tiles.
  \
  ![cue](https://i.imgur.com/v1h1FB8.png)
  \
  Try to neutral climbjump up the dash blocks and aim the third climbjump so you jump off the top corner of the second dashblock as shown above. Hold right after that last neutral climbjump to reach the retreating dash block. Neutral climbjump off it and diag demo so you reach the ceiling later and have more height. You can do a second upright demo for safety if you can't get over with just a right dash consistently.

  \
  Get a low height cornerboost in the previous room and buffer the dash for the wavedash out of transition. Jump late on the wavedash so you get a lot of coyote. Buffer all 3 dashes(right, upright demo, downright) when you reach the corner. 
  \
  ![cue](https://i.imgur.com/N9iCVTS.png)
  \
  Right dash and buffer the next one when you're inbetween the background tile and the pillar above you.

  The beginning of the room is kinda self explanatory. For the second fish I like to hold jump on the first one and downright in the middle of the bg tile. Then hold jump and right and updash when you're close to the spinners. Hold right and right dash when at peak height of the updash.</br>
  **Important:** This strat only works on entry because it is fish cycle dependent. Yes, the fish' move slightly and that alters their hitbox as well. I don't know if this strat even works on console as fish cycles are slightly different compared to PC. Please let me know if this strat works if you are a console player.

  Transition demohyper and do the downright in the middle of the lower part of the background tile. Exiting the dreamblock you want to do a small jump for the dreamhyper so you always get a low position in the next dreamblock. Buffer the downright out of that dreamhyper. Buffer demo and upright dash out of the dreamblock and dreamhyper onto the fish. Immediately downright and the rest is pretty self explanatory. Not a lot of cues for this room sadly, but I hope the written explanation helps a bit.

  Start the jump for the wallbounce at the 2 little cracks in the wall. Dash early and buffer the dashes
  \

  \
  I tried to find something to make this not feel like RNG, but sometimes depending on positioning you can't buffer the left demo. Either take the gamble or just slowfall a bit and make sure to not buffer.

  Important for the upright into the jelly is to do it into the bottom left or bottom of it and hold downright after. If you do it into the middle left side you can be too high even if you fast fall all the way. Also this upright isn't fast, you can instead just jump late on the wavedash to get the same speed.
  \
  ![cue](https://i.imgur.com/MBL0KG2.png)
  \
  Not really a cue, but to guarantee a clean landing, throw the jelly pretty late before the jelly regrab.

  Jump on the right side of the moonblock and updash when you're past it. If you hit that moonblock with a jump or dash bail out and do a different strat. Delay left dash until you're max height and then buffer the next 4 dashes. For the last dash space it out to gain more height.

  Get onto the middle of the ground and do a medium jump in place. This should bring Madeline's head barely over the spinners but even being a bit low doesn't matter that much.
  Throw the jelly, land, jump into the bubble and fast activate it. Then time the updash through the gap. FYI: You can hold grab all the way when inside the bubble.</br>
  For the last dash either neutral drop the jelly or throw it and updash. If you throw it you have to pay attention of not being too far left as throwing a jelly pushes you into the direction you're not facing.

  Wallkick of the left wall after the transition and release jump when you reach the end of the wooden platform or the bg tile above the red line on the pic. You can practically choose your visual cue. Do a small jump and throw the jelly when close to the spinners. Buffer updash, downleft and then fast activate the bubble. You can also dash left and slow activate the bubble if you prefer that.

  Buffer the jump on the demohyper in the previous room. Hold jump for the whole strat even after the jelly grab. Buffer a downright after the transition and delay the grab for the jelly. Hold upright and the jump from the hyper and you should glide through the gap. 
  \
  ![cue](https://i.imgur.com/4E880JN.png)
  \
  Hold downright past the door. </br>
  If the grab delay is awkward you can neutral demohyper. So demohyper without holding right. This loses quite a bit of time but you can hold grab with this.
  \
  No cue for the end part, but just a tip; because of jelly throw cooldown you can release grab immediately and the end strat just works as long as the jelly was thrown high enough up initially.

  Even the beginning part is a setup for this room. Try to hit the left side of the spring, don't move and just press dash to get to the spring again. Wait until you start falling and then upright dash and hold right and jump and you will get a good angle to do the next part.

Dash downright through the crystal to keep both dashes and grab the block. When it starts moving you want to release grab and do 3 right dashes and 1 updash. Drift to the left, grab the jelly and then do a small jump of the block.

  Binoclip is a funny strat that is not too difficult after practicing it a bit but definitely weird at first. First you want to make sure to interact with the bino from the left so you face right. To do that consistently, hold jump on the demohyper and downright dash when you're in the middle of the first part of that green background tile and buffer a downdash.
  \
  ![cue](https://i.imgur.com/IrcUiSJ.png)
  You then want to move the bino until the double spinners on the bottom disappear.
  \
  Exit the bino and the moment the white arrows on the side of the screen that indicate you can move the camera start disappearing you want to do an extended neutral super. So dash without holding a direction and jump a bit later. Getting the extention has no clear feedback so you just have to pray and rely on muscle memory.

  Can be an annoying room because of the downright and feel impossible but if you wait until the block has reached the very end of the track and you are up roughly 2/3 or 3/4 of the block it works. Semi decent cue for that is if Madeline's hand is horizontally alligned with the green part of the block. Then jump and buffer the downright dash out of the crystal freeze frames.

  You can buffer the updash into right dash for the super at the beginning of the room.</br>
  After hitting the coin, if you dash high into the dreamblock you can dreamhyper out of that specific dreamblock. If you're low just jump out how you normally would.

The jump timing for the cornerkick will feel weird as you slide under the wall but just make sure to input the jump slightly later than you think.

  Not really a cue but just showing the earliest and latest frame for the downright. Really weird but can be consistent with practice as it's a 3f window(4f technically but you don't land on the ground on the first frame). I personally try to be just above the first of the bottom spinners on the right but as it's really rough I put the whole frame window here.

  Really hard room, I recommend practicing this room a lot and having a good death cycle for this ([example death strat](https://clips.twitch.tv/ArtsySpikyEmuPastaThat-1ti1YP0oBIVWiw-E)).
  \
  Full height transition wallbounce and buffer 2 updashes when you're in line with the sticking out bg tile above you. Don't move until you hit the ice ball.
  \

  \
  Upright dash when under the sticking out part off the bg tile and delay the right dash until max height. Hold neutral for the iceball super and hold jump. Then you can do a left dash to get another ice ball super. Hold jump on that one as well and dash up into the left coin. Wait until max height off the updash and then do a right dash and release directions and also hold jump for a neutral ice ball super. Downright when inside the coin within the fireballs and the rest should line up.

  Wavedash into the room, hold jump and downright dash when you're past the ceiling like in the first screenshot.

  Dash down when the kevin reaches the 2nd hole of that pair of background holes. Buffer 3 downdashes, a downright and a left dash to get the right timing for the kevin to fit through the breakable blocks. Don't move after the last dash into the kevin and climbjump and upleft to the coin.

  First you have to know you can be too fast with your feather movement so slow down a bit. I like to just not optimize the turns at the beginning.
  \
  As long as you're at the bottom of the screen and in between the position that shows on the picture you can buffer everything. It's an updemo into a downleft, jump off the block and upright and then cornerboost.

  Yes I put the beginning afterwards because it's less important. Downright in the small dent of the bg tiles and jump and cornerboost after transition was the most consistent for me.

## Stubbornness

 \
 The cycles in stubbornness are not quite "global" as lots of folks will say they are. The only "global" aspect of them is the amount of progress between the "strong" and "weak" beats, aka the progress between color changes, when you hit a room transition. The current state of what color blocks are active does not carry between rooms at all.
 \
 As for what color will be active when you enter the next room, it seems designed around the idea that after you hit the transition, the next color change you see will be blue blocks activating. That means you'll usually see the color before blue as active when the transition ends.
 \
 The only exception to this is when you hit a transition immediately before colors change (there's some threshold that i'm not sure of). In that case, I guess the decision was that they don't want blue to activate too quickly after the transition, so instead the active color will be 2 colors before blue in the cycle instead of just 1. This can be confusing because there are a few rooms that only have blue and pink blocks, so 2 colors before blue is blue again.

  \
  Upwards transition add a dash cooldown to Madeline so I skip the cutscene a bit later so I can buffer an input afterwards without getting owned. I do that when Madeline's feet reach the platform on the left.
  \
  ![cue](https://i.imgur.com/FPUnNyH.png)
  \
  I do 2 downrights into the corner to setup the cycle, then you can either wait a bit and jump to not get a wavedash or just climbjump immediately after to be safe. Wavedash and try to jump late so you have more speed on the ultra. Downright over the blue block and make sure to not buffer the jump. Upright close to the pink block and either wait a bit and then start a hyper with a slight extension or you can squeeze out another downdash. The important part here is that you enter the next room when the green block in this room appears.

  \
  If you did the entry correctly into this room you should be able to do a downright here at the beginning and then climbjump up to be able to wavedash and ultra off the blue block. Don't buffer the jump but don't get huge coyote as you can make it impossible to get a demo window as you need to be falling for that. Lining up Madeline's bottom hair pixel with the outsticking top part off the spinner is the cue I use for the demo.
  \
  ![cue](https://i.imgur.com/hg2mw66.png)
  \
  Hiken uses a different cue: When the bottom pixel of Madeline's hairline is under the "Resume" text is the cue that he uses. If you use pause menu cues, make sure to disable "Mod Options" showing in-game as any additional option in the menu will change the position of the text. Of course this also applies to variants or assist or anything else that adds a menu option.</br>
  Fast fall immediately after the demo as the cycle is tight. If you entered the room too late the blue block disappeared. Very sad day but it's a hard cycle. 
 
  ![gif](https://github.com/Tiyo98/farewell-cue-collection/blob/main/images/farewell/i-00b-safe.webp)
  \
  If you don't wanna do the demo I recommend this strat. Also good when you die so learn it either way. You have to hold jump off the wallbounce while still grabbing the green block as you need the half gravity. You climb up to the top and hold right+jump. Because of the half gravity at the beginning you barely make it to the pink block and can then climb up the block and buffer a downright into the spring. Otherwise you can be too fast.

  \
  Doing 8 downdashes lines up the dash to the spring and then going through the pink dash block. If you don't wanna count or miss the buffer the beat in between the cycle is a good cue. [Here the room video with sound](https://youtu.be/qLc4kBs0lek) to easier notice it. Exiting the room when the blue blocks appear and/or 3 downdashes line it up decently well to hyper out.

  Like previously mentioned, hyper into the room and wavedash off the lower ground. Upright when inside the edge of the blue block left of the gap and buffer jump. You can do the upright later but I personally was too fast at the very end if I did that. Also I personally try to not do a fullheight jump. Upright through the block and buffer another jump. Depending on when you upright through the crystal you can hold right. If you upright too late you have to release right for a bit and adjust. Not much else to say about this room except that you wanna hold grab at the end in case you have to climbjump.

  Have to get a clean room before and see how, and if, it even works for your strat but it definitely works with the common high level strat which enters the room right before the pink block disappears. Updash into the pink block and fast fall into the bubble. Then fast bubble everything and downright dash and hold downright at the edge of the blue block. You can dash right into the third bubble of the room which can make buffering easier, but you should experiment yourself.

  \
  **Normal!!!** upright dash when between the blue and yellow block. A demo will send you too high after hitting the spring because you reach the spring later. Also holding grab will cause you to grab the pink block so refrain from holding grab here as well.</br>
  See if skipping the pink block or not is easier for you. Should barely make a time difference.

  This strat is kinda weird but I personally jump and wait until I'm above the electricity before doing a downdash and then super and updemo. An updemo allows you to just hold grab without flying away when grabbing the jelly.

  Another thing that is hard but has 3 parts to make it more managable. First thing which I didn't screenshot is to hit the spring on the right side. Release directions and shortly after launching of the spring start holding right again. For me this is after passing the bottom part of the electricity on the left where I repress right. After Madeline's head passes the bottom of the electricity you throw the jelly and do a normal upright when in the middle of the vaporisation gate.

  Ok first, demo into the bird because you will be launched higher if you do that. With this you can skip doing a climbjump before hitting the spring.
  \
  Downright when you reach the side of the lower corner. Doing it later loses a bunch of time.

  I personally do this because it's the easiest to optimise, this is not necessarily faster. Downright on the left side of this higher spinner of this gap to hit the box for the first time. Then you can just hold downright and buffer a downright dash on the power box and buffer downleft into it to hit it a second time.

  Not really a cue but this room has 2 things that aren't obvious from just looking at a run. First after the badeline orb you just release grab on the pickup animation and you will throw the jelly at the perfect position to be able to right dash into it. Second you jump after breaking the power source box in coyote time. This gives you a bit more height to be able to demohyper or cornerboost out of the room. Hold grab to cornerboost if you're too low.

  If you hyper bhop and upright into the jelly and held grab beforehand, you can just hold right and you will hit the left side of the spring. Then you want to get really close to the electricity (see screenshot) before throwing the jelly and upright dashing. Then right dash at peak height of the updash and hold grab after.

  First part of the room sucks but you just have to make sure to hit the 2nd fish high with an upleft so you can downright onto the third fish in the room. After getting to the bird right dash again at the rubble and hold downright. Technically downdash is faster but harder to optimise and to get to the right position for the next strat.

  Start the reverse hyper when under the middle of this lower bit of electricity. This is more lenient than it seems and at worse you will most often just hit Badeline.

  This final room is long and tedious and actually has quite a few a strats that either can save quite a bit or are can be made relatively easy with cues. I will break up the room in a lot of little gifs and talk about them.

  \
  First is this cutscene ultra. You lose a lot of speed if you don't skip the cutscene early so you have to really greed that pause. I personally pause when Madeline reaches the corner.
  \
  Next up is going under the second fish.

  \
  Get close to the bottom of the dotted line and throw the jelly and release right just to the left of the fish. Then fall down a bit and upright when the jelly is to the right of the fish.
  \
  No picture for the end of that clip but just make sure to throw the jelly right before the electricity and fall a bit and then downleft into the fish. Also don't fishboost, just hold left until the next dash. Upright into the jelly and hold left before reaching the wall that vaporises the jelly.

  The blue squid in the background is our friend. Throw the jelly to the left when in the middle of it.

  \
  First you have to know to hold downright here before you get to the platform and until right after you jump to not accidentally throw it. To throw it at the coin just throw it when the top of the jelly reaches the bottom pixel of the electricity.

  \
  For this downright, just do the dash when in the middle of the lower edge of the electricity. To get to the feather you often have to release right for a brief moment or tap left on keyboard. You will get a feel for it with practice.

  \
  If you're on keyboard or for some reason use dpad feathers, a good cue to go downleft on the feather is right above the fish. You have to do it slightly later if you cut it really close to the fish. Also if you want to go extra safe, later is better anyway but you don't have to move past the fish before moving downleft.
  \
  Also on the fast fall before the upleft demo into the spring: Tap right once otherwise your position is slightly awkward and you won't be able to consistently hit the spring with an upleft demo.

  \
  The hyper is a way bigger window than you might think. Stand in the middle of the block and start an extended hyper when the corner of the block gets past the corner of the electricity. Also hold jump even after the jelly grab for half gravity.
  \
  Quick note for the upright into the jelly after the fish boost: If you upright really early you can hit the electricity if you just hold right. Just upright later to prevent that.

  \
  The final stretch. There is some easy timesave that you can miss that I will note down: First, not in the gif but jump after the first dash into the block to cancel your momentum. Then after dashing into the bird make sure to hold right to get to the orbs and buffer updashes into the birds. Any other movement like dashing right or releasing right loses unnecessary time without changing the difficulty.
  \
  Finally updash when in line with the 2nd last spinner before the orb and the chapter is done!
