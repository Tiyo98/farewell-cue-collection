# Farewell DTS
![header](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/752203178715644024/901051628013105212/20211022121702_1.jpg)
**Important note:** This is for Farewell with the Dash Trigger Skip or short DTS which allows you to play Farewell up to Stubborness with 2 dashes. Cues for 1 dash Farewell are not planned as of yet, but some strats are similar and from [Stubbornness](#stubbornness) onwards it's the same as 1 dash.
\
Jelly mechanics are kinda weird at first so I recommend you give [Jelly Mechanics](https://github.com/Tiyo98/farewell-cue-collection/blob/main/jellymechanics.md) a read as I mostly assume in this that you know them.
Also moonblocks move on a cycle so be aware of that if you set save states or use the debug map when practicing.

  \
  Pausebuffer a talk out of a pause and then a jump out of the next pause. You can't interact with the grave in dash state so you have to wait until it's over or don't dash. Important that you have to release talk before the jump. Can also use a pause+talk button but be aware that you have to release it before the unpause is over.
  \
  There are 2 options now. You can count how many bounces the white arrow in the bottom right of thext box does. Skip the cutscene after 11 bounces. Or alternatively wait until Madeline is off screen and look at the timer and wait 15 seconds before skipping the cutscene.

   Do an updash and an upright to get to the moonblock. Land and buffer an updash and delay another updash. Buffer a left jump when you land again. Wallkick of the moonblock while holding right and when you're in line with it, do a right dash and neutral super. The jump of the super should not be in coyote, so try to aim for middle or right side of the block.
   Do an updemo and drift slightly to the right before doing the right dash.
   \
   An annoying part is the trigger you don't see, so I recommend practicing with the hitbox view of [Celeste TAS](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6715). For more setups I recommend the [video guide by fishmcmuffins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al_3Wu27C4M).

  Try to neutral climbjump up and hold right for the last climbjump. That last climbjump should be on the top part of the dash block. After the neutral jump of the retreating dash block you want to diag demo so you reach the ceiling later and have more height. You can do a second upright demo for safety if you can't get over with a right dash consistently..,..

  Transition demohyper and do the downright in the middle of the lower part of the background tile. Exiting the dreamblock you want to do a small jump for the dreamhyper so you always get a low position in the next dreamblock. Buffer the downright out of that dreamhyper. Buffer demo and upright dash out of the dreamblock and do a short dreamhyper onto the fish. Immediately downright and the rest is pretty self explanatory. Not a lot of cues for this room sadly, but I hope the written explanation helps a bit.

  This should work if you buffer the dashes when you fastfall but if you slowfall at some point you can die. Can also try to react instead of buffer and do it in the middle of the crystal.

  Important for the upright into the jelly is to do it into the bottom left or bottom of it. If you do it into the middle left side you can be too high even if you fast fall all the way.

  \
  Not really a cue, but to guarentee a clean landing, throw the jelly pretty late before the jelly regrab.

  Jump on the right side of the moonblock and updash when you're past it. If you hit that moonblock with a jump or dash bail out and do a different strat. Delay left dash until you're max height and then buffer the next 4 dashes. For the last dash space it out to gain more height.

  Get onto the middle of the ground and do a medium jump in place. This should bring Madeline's head barely over the spinners but even being a bit low doesn't matter that much.
  Throw the jelly, land, jump into the bubble and fast activate it. Then time the updash through the gap. FYI: You can hold grab all the way when inside the bubble.
  For the last dash either neutral drop the jelly or throw it and updash. If you throw it you have to pay attention of not being too far left as throwing a jelly pushes you into the direction you're not facing.

  Wallkick of the left wall after the transition and release jump when you reach the end of the wooden platform or the bg tile above the red line on the pic. You can practically choose your visual cue. Do a small jump and throw the jelly when close to the spinners. Buffer updash, downleft and then fast activate the bubble. You can also dash left and slow activate the bubble if you prefer that.

  The strat is significantly easier if you jump a bit later for the demohyper in the previous room. Release jump for the hyper in the transition and then hold downright after. When you reach the cue release down and only hold right.
  \
  No cue for the end part, but just a tip; because of jelly throw cooldown you can release grab immediately and the end strat just works.

Drift to the left, grab the jelly and then do a small jump of the block.

  Binoclip is a funny strat that is not too difficult after practicing it a bit but definitely weird at first. First you want to make sure to interact with the bino from the left so you face right. To do that consistently, hold jump on the demohyper and downright dash when you're in the middle of the first part of that green background tile and buffer a downdash.
  \
  ![cue](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/752203178715644024/965989776274649129/unknown.png)
  You then want to move the bino until the double spinners on the bottom disappear.
  \
  Exit the bino and the moment the white arrows on the side of the screen that indicate you can move the camera start disappearing you want to do an extended neutral super. So dash without holding a direction and jump a bit later. Getting the extention has no clear feedback so you just have to pray and rely on muscle memory.

  Can be an annoying room because of the downright and feel impossible but if you wait until the block has reached the very end of the track and you are up roughly 2/3 or 3/4 of the block it works. Semit decent cue for that is if Madeline's hand is horizontally alligned with the green part of the block

  Getting under is quite lenient but still look for these 2 visually different hand animations for the grab to be safe and you should be fine

  You can buffer the updash into right dash for the super at the beginning of the room.</b>
  After hitting the coin, if you dash high into the dreamblock you can dreamhyper out of that specific dreamblock. If you're low just jump out how you normally would.
  \
  For the end part, you want to upleft demo when you're under the last spinner

  Long room that can be made decently consistent. Start an extended super or hyper when the moving block reaches the third spinner pillar. Super is easier than hyper but it doesn't matter.

  \
  Do a tiny jump when you're between the two spinners and upright when you're in line with the background pillar. Also have to be pretty low before the upright, roughly when the feet touches the spinners.

  Hit the spring low and fast fall and buffer a climbjump. Upright dash when you're past the bottom spinner and uprgiht demo when you're close to the right wall with spinners. The jump timing for the cornerkick will feel weird as you slide under the wall but just make sure to input the jump slightly later than you think.

  Not really a cue but just showing the earliest and latest frame for the downright. Really weird but can be consistent with practice as it's a 3f window(4f technically but you don't land on the ground on the first frame). I personally try to be just above the first of the bottom spinners on the right but as it's really rough I put the whole frame window here.

  Really hard room, I recommend practicing this room a lot and having a good death cycle for this ([example death strat](https://clips.twitch.tv/ArtsySpikyEmuPastaThat-1ti1YP0oBIVWiw-E)).
  \
  Full height transition wallbounce and buffer 2 updashes when you're in line with the sticking out bg tile above you. Don't move until you hit the ice ball.

  Upright dash when under the sticking out part off the bg tile and delay the right dash until max height. Hold neutral for the iceball super and hold jump. Then you can do a left dash to get another ice ball super. Hold jump on that one as well and dash up into the left coin. Wait until max height off the updash and then do a right dash and release directions and also hold jump for a neutral ice ball super. Downright when inside the coin within the fireballs and the rest should line up.

  Line up Madeline with the right eye of kevin and dash down when the kevin reaches the 2nd hole of that pair of background holes. Buffer 3 downdashes, a downright and a left dash to get the right timing for the kevin to fit through the breakable blocks.

  First you have to know you can be too fast with your feather movement so slow down a bit. I like to just not optimize the turns at the beginning.
  \
  As long as you're at the bottom of the screen and in between the position that shows on the picture you can buffer everything. It's an updemo into a downleft, jump off the block and upright and then cornerboost.

  \
  Yes I put the beginning afterwards because it's less important. Downright in the small dent of the bg tiles and jump and cornerboost after transition was the most consistent for me.

 First for Stubbornness you have to know that the cycles are global instead of only covering a single room like in the rest of the game. As the cycles are different speed you may wonder how they work which is actually pretty simple. Think of a full cycle as a loading progress bar and that progress gets carried over into the next room. This also means that practicing and learning rooms is a pain here so when practicing try to pausebuffer save states and play through the rooms normally to not mess with the cycles.

  Upwards transition add a dash cooldown to Madeline so I skip the cutscene a bit later so I can buffer an input afterwards without getting owned. I do that when Madeline's feet reach the platform on the left.

  \
  I do 2 downrights into the corner to setup the cycle, then you can either wait a bit and jump to not get a wavedash or just climbjump immediately after to be safe. Wavedash and try to jump late so you have more speed on the ultra. Downright over the blue block and make sure to not buffer the jump. Upright close to the pink block and either wait a bit and then start a hyper with a slight extension or you can squeeze out another downdash. The important part here is that you enter the next room when the green block in this room appears.

  \
  If you did the entry correctly into this room you should be able to do a downright here at the beginning and then climbjump up to be able to wavedash and ultra off the blue block. Don't buffer the jump but don't get huge coyote as you can make it impossible to get a demo window as you need to be falling for that. Lining up Madeline's bottom hair pixel with the outsticking top part off the spinner is the cue I use for the demo. Fast fall immediately after the demo as the cycle is tight. If you entered the room too late the blue block disappeared. Very sad day but it's a hard cycle.

  \
  If you don't wanna do the demo I recommend this strat. Also good when you die so learn it either way. You have to hold jump off the wallbounce while still grabbing the green block as you need the half gravity. You climb up to the top and hold right+jump. Because of the half gravity at the beginning you barely make it to the pink block and can then climb up the block and buffer a downright into the spring. Otherwise you can be too fast.

  Doing 8 downdashes lines up the dash to the spring and then going through the pink dash block. If you don't wanna count or miss the buffer the beat in between the cycle is a good cue. [Here the room video with sound](https://youtu.be/qLc4kBs0lek) to easier notice it. Exiting the room when the blue blocks appear and/or 3 downdashes line it up decently well to hyper out.

  Like previously mentioned, hyper into the room and wavedash off the lower ground. Upright when inside the edge of the blue block left of the gap and buffer jump. You can do the upright later but I personally was too fast at the very end if I did that. Also I personally try to not do a fullheight jump. Upright through the block and buffer another jump. Depending on when you upright through the crystal you can hold right. If you upright too late you have to release right for a bit and adjust. Not much else to say about this room except that you wanna hold grab at the end in case you have to climbjump.

  Have to get a clean room before and see how and if it even works for your strat but it definitely works with the common high level strat. Updash into the pink block and fast fall into the bubble. Then fast bubble everything and downright at the edge of the blue block.

  Normal!!! upright dash when between the blue and yellow block. A demo will send you too high after hitting the spring because you reach the spring later. See if skipping the pink block or not is easier for you. Should barely make a time difference.
