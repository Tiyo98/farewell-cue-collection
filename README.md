## Introduction
This will show the cues for some minor or major strats I personally use in Farewell. This will only have Farewell with the Dash Trigger Skip for now as it's the most relevant way to speedrun this chapter currently as it saves one minute compared to no DTS, but some strats are applicable for 1-Dash Farwell. 
\
**Notes**: This is most often strats that I use, not necessarily the fastest ones. Also some strats I don't really use cues for them or they are relatively easy to be replicable by watching a run, so they will not be listed. For nearly every strat I use a cue, it will be listed here though. This is in no way a complete guide to learn the chapter, it's only a way to assist with learning it. If you have a cue that you think should be added or you spot a mistake, dm me on Discord (tiyo98).
\
I assume the reader already knows what each tech is named and what they do. I will not explain them here. If you need further help, go to the [Celeste discord server](https://discord.com/invite/celeste) and ask in the #speedrun-help channel.
## Formatting
This collection will be split up into the respective checkpoints with 4 preview gifs per checkpoint to avoid needing to load 50+ gifs at a time for every room when checking the page. Each checkpoint can be accessed with the table of contents found at the beginning of the chapter page and will follow the format given below.
Attached below are some drawings of format of the guide, and you should read it as such. Shoutouts to koralreef for these.
