This section will explain all relevant jelly mechanics for speedrunning farewell, that where not needed when playing through the chapter casually. There are some pretty niche ones so I recommend reading them even if you think you know most of them.

## Basic Mechanics
\
 Already with just normally grabbing a jelly there are some differences with how you fall when holding it.

 \
 First there is fast falling with a jelly and holding no direction. For fast falling you just hold down. Both of these are pretty self explanatory.

 \
 Holding up makes you fall significantly slower. Pretty useful if you want to travel a lot of distance without losing too much height.

 \
 At the peak of your height you fall significantly less when holding jump. Combining that with pressing "up" you fall even slower. Be aware it only matters **at roughly the peak of your height**. It doesn't work after a certain amount of falling.

## Jellyvator

 \
 Jellyvators make use of a useful mechanic where you drop hold down before releasing the grab which makes the jelly drop in place. You can dash up into it afterwards to gain a huge height boost. This is a Jellyvator.

## Jellyultra

 \
 When you dash diagonally down with momentum like from a hyper you keep your speed until the dash runs out. If you hit the ground you gain a 1.2x speed modifier but that also runs out when the dash runs out. This can be canceled when picking up objects like jellies which lets you fly across the screen.
 
----
## Regrabs
\

 \
 You can buffer dash before releasing grab to make the regrab a bit easier.

 \
 There is a certain period after grabbing a jelly where you can't throw it. This is only useful in 2 places but it's very good to know.

----
## Backboosts
\

 \
 Throwing a jelly gives you backwards momenutum for a very short ammount of time. If you throw it backwards and immediately dash you keep that backwards momentum.

## Others

 \
 When repressing down on the ground you drop the jelly.

 \
 If you hold down all the way without releasing it at all you don't drop it though.

 \
 Delaying your grab input can mean you gain more height as you get the boost later.

 \
 You can also delay the grab input so much that you don't get a boost at all.

 \
 There is also a delay of regrabbing a jelly. When you buffer a dash to regrab a jelly the dash ends before you're able to regrab it. For demos this is important as you can only grab a jelly when crouched while in dash state. But as the dash ended you have to wait until you're uncrouched as you can't grab it while crouched. This happens when you start falling so you don't have upwards momentum that gives you a boost. The same principle applys if you reach a jelly late like in the 2nd gif as the dash ended before you reach it.
