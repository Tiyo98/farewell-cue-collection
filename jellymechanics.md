This section will explain all relevant jelly mechanics for speedrunning Farewell that were not needed when playing through the chapter casually. There are some pretty niche ones so I recommend reading them even if you think you know most of them.

## Basic Mechanics
\
 Already with just normally grabbing a jelly there are some differences with how you fall when holding it.

 \
 First there is falling with a jelly and holding no direction. For fast falling you just hold down. Both of these are pretty self explanatory.

 \
 Holding up makes you fall significantly slower. Pretty useful if you want to travel a lot of distance without losing too much height.

 \
 At the peak of your height you fall significantly less when holding jump. Combining that with pressing "up" you fall even slower. Be aware it only matters **at roughly the peak of your height**. It doesn't work after a certain amount of falling.</b>
 Also a bunch of things give you auto jump so pressing or holding jump makes no difference. This includes but is not limited to springs and dashes besides downward angled ones.

## Jellyvator

 \
 Jellyvators make use of a useful mechanic where you drop it by releasing grab while holding down which makes the jelly drop in place. You can dash up into it afterwards and grab the jelly to gain a huge height boost. This is a Jellyvator.

## Jellyultra
\

 \
 When you dash diagonally down with speed like from a hyper, you keep your speed until the dash runs out. If you hit the ground, you gain a 1.2x speed modifier, but your resulting speed only lasts until the dash ends. To avoid losing speed at the end of the dash, you can cancel the dash by picking up objects like jellies and this lets you fly across the screen.
 
----
## Regrabs
\

 \
 You can buffer dash before releasing grab to make the regrab a bit easier.

 \
 There is a certain period after grabbing a jelly where you can't throw it. In the above clip it shows how you can release grab any time before this period is over, and the jelly will just get thrown as soon as possible. This is only useful in a handful of places but it's very good to know.

----
## Backboosts
\

 \
 Throwing a jelly gives you some speed in the opposite direction. This typically doesn't last long because the extra speed decays due to friction. By dashing immediately after throwing a jelly backwards, you're able to keep that extra speed for a bit longer.

## Others

 \
 Repressing down on the ground you drop the jelly.

 \
 However, if down is pressed before reaching the ground and is continuously held, you won't drop it.

 \
 Delaying your grab input can mean you gain more height as you get the boost later.

 \
 You can also delay the grab input so much that you don't get a boost at all.

 \
 There is also a cooldown of regrabbing a jelly. When you buffer the dash for a regrab, the dash ends before you're able to regrab it. This is important for regrabs that use demo since the only way to grab a jelly when crouched is if you're in dash state. Buffering the demo means you can't grab the jelly during dash state since grabbing the jelly is still in cooldown. After the dash ends, you're still crouched until you get uncrouched from moving downwards. This means the earliest possible grab is when you start moving downwards after dash state is over, so you won't get the boost. The same principle applies if you reach a jelly late like in the 2nd gif as the dash ended before you reach it.
